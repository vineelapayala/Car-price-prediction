Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project predicts the price of second-hand cars based on features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, kilometers driven, and owner type. It uses the Linear Regression algorithm from scikit-learn.

Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

Applies one-hot encoding to features like car name, company, and fuel type.

Builds a linear regression model to predict car prices.

Includes a simple Flask web interface for user interaction.
